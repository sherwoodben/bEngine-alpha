## Modifications by sherwoodben

The contents of this directory have been modified from the source repository (in fact only the license is copied!). The original license is maintained in the "LICENSE" file. In the "/include/" directory I have included a header file which was generated with the [webservice for glad2](https://glad.sh). I have made no modification to the source code (other than to move it into the "/include/" subdirectory). The generated source code contains licensing information (which is present in the "LICENSE" file as well). The settings used to generate the header file can be found in the comments at the top of the file.

The license blurb from the original README is maintained below as well.

## License

For the source code and various Khronos files see [LICENSE](/LICENSE).

The generated code from glad is any of Public Domain, WTFPL or CC0.
Now Khronos has some of their specifications under Apache Version 2.0
license which may have an impact on the generated code,
[see this clarifying comment](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenGL-Registry/issues/376#issuecomment-596187053)
on the Khronos / OpenGL-Specification issue tracker.
