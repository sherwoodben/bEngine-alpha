## Modifications by sherwoodben

The contents of this directory have been modified from the source repository; only the minimal files required to actually use glm in a project have been included. The original license is maintained in the "copying.txt" file. I have made no modification to the source code (other than to move it into an "/include/" subdirectory), only "cleaned up" to reduce clutter when using in other projects!
